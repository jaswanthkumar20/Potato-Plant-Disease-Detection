# 🍠 Potato Plant Disease Detection Using YOLOv5  

This project focuses on detecting potato plant health conditions using **YOLOv5**. The model is trained on a **real-time dataset** collected via drones flying over potato farms. Early detection of stressed plants can help farmers take preventive measures, improving crop yield and quality.  

## 📌 Features  
- **Real-time Dataset**: Collected using drones over potato farming land.  
- **Binary Classification**: Labels - **Healthy** and **Stressed**.  
- **YOLOv5 Model**: Utilized for real-time object detection.  
- **Image Preprocessing**: Augmentation, resizing, and normalization for improved accuracy.  
- **Training & Evaluation**: Assessed with precision, recall, mAP, and F1-score.  
- **Real-Time Inference**: Detects and classifies plant stress conditions on aerial images.  
- **Potential Deployment**: Suitable for integration into drone-based monitoring systems.  

## 📂 Dataset  
- **Source**: Captured via drones flying over potato farms.  
- **Labels**:  
  - **Healthy** 🟢: Plants in good condition.  
  - **Stressed** 🔴: Indicators of disease, nutrient deficiency, or water stress.
